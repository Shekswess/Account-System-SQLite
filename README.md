Account-System-SQLite

-This project is made for practicing and gaining experience with sqlite through a practical simple application.

-The goal of this project is to make something simple but effective project.

-This Project is designed as short resume Project. With this Project I want to try some basic operations with a database using sqlite, creating table, inserting elements, deleting elements, getting them, etc.

-Maybe this Project can be upgraded or better optimised but I'm satisfied.

-To run the project you need to have python3 installed. You download the code and you open the folder where the code is using the command line. You write:

python main.py
You will be greeted with a "menu" what you can do with the system !

-I hope you like this project and find it helpful !
